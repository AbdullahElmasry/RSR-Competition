Unfortunately, I Wasn't Lucky In This Competition
But I Promise I Will Make My Own Luck By The Next One, So Wait For Me ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to thank the circumstances that allowed me to participate in the competition alone, despite all the teams consisting of 3 to 6 members and being able to compete with them on equal footing. I was able to gather a vast amount of experience to use in the next round with confidence in winning. I also don't forget to credit my friends for lending me a helping hand at times.
